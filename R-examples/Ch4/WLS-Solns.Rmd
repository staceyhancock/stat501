## Professor Ratings

Bleske-Rechek and Fritsch (2011) analyzed a data set of the
ratings of 366 instructors at one large campus in the Midwest.
Each instructor in the data had at least 10 ratings over a several
year period. Students provided ratings from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
These data are built into R in the `alr4` library.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(alr4)
data(Rateprof)
```

Let $Y_{ij}$ be the quality rating of the $i$th instructor by the $j$th student,
$j = 1,\ldots, n_i$, and $\bar{Y}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} Y_{ij}/n_i$ be the mean quality
rating for the $i$th instructor. Similarly, let $x_{1ij}$ and $x_{2ij}$ be the easiness
and helpfulness ratings, respectively, of the $i$th instructor by the $j$th student,
with mean easiness and mean helpfulness for the $i$th instructor denoted by
$\bar{x}_{1i}$ and $\bar{x}_{2i}$. Note that the data set only reports
mean ratings, not individual student's ratings.

Do in class:

1. Assume $E(Y_{ij} | X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1ij} + \beta_2 x_{2ij}$ and
$Var(Y_{ij} | X) = \sigma^2$. Derive the expression for $E(\bar{Y}_{i} | X)$
and $Var(\bar{Y}_i | X)$.

\begin{eqnarray*}
E(\bar{Y}_{i} | X) &=& \frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} E(Y_{ij}|X)\\
&=& \frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_{1ij} + \beta_2 x_{2ij}) \\
&=& \beta_0 + \beta_1 \bar{x}_{1i} + \beta_2 \bar{x}_{2i}
\end{eqnarray*}

2. If we fit a linear model to $E(\bar{Y}_{i} | X)$, would it meet
the constant variance assumption? Explain why or why not.

    _No. The variance of $Y_i$ depends on $n_i$. Assuming $Y_{ij}$ is independent of $Y_{ik}$ for $j \neq k$_,
    $$
    Var(\bar{Y}_i | X) = \frac{1}{n_i^2} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} Var(Y_{ij} | X) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n_i}.
    $$

3. Let $\mathbf{Y} = \begin{pmatrix} \bar{Y}_1 & \bar{Y}_2 & \cdots & \bar{Y}_{366} \end{pmatrix}'$
be the response vector for this data set with variance-covariance matrix
Var$(\mathbf{Y}) = \sigma^2 \boldsymbol{\Omega}$. Write out the elements in the first four
rows and first four columns of $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$, i.e., report the $4 \times 4$
matrix that consists of elements in rows $1-4$ and columns $1-4$.

\begin{eqnarray*}

\end{eqnarray*}

4. Generate plots to investigate the distributions and relationships
between the three variables of interest.
```{r}
hist(Rateprof$quality, breaks=15, col="gray", 
   xlab="Average quality rating", 
   main ="Histogram of Average quality rating", ylim=c(0,45))
hist(Rateprof$helpfulness, breaks=15, col="gray", 
   xlab="Average helpfulness rating", 
   main ="Histogram of Average helpfulness rating", ylim=c(0,45))
hist(Rateprof$easiness, breaks=15, col="gray", 
   xlab="Average easiness rating", 
   main ="Histogram of Average easiness rating", ylim=c(0,45))
plot(Rateprof[,c(8,9,11)])
cor(Rateprof[,c(8,9,11)])
```

5. Fit the weighted least squares model. Write the equation of
the fitted model, and interpret each of the three fitted coefficients
in context of the problem.
```{r}
mod <- lm(quality ~ easiness + helpfulness, weights = numRaters, data = Rateprof)
summary(mod)
```

6. Fit the ordinary least squares fit to these data. How do the coefficients
change? How does the residual standard error change? Why?
```{r}
mod.OLS <- lm(quality ~ easiness + helpfulness, data = Rateprof)
summary(mod.OLS)
