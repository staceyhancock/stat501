The purpose of the final project is to explore topics in probability that we did not cover
in class, or to explore topics we covered in class in further detail, and to share these
explorations with your classmates. 

I am intentionally leaving the project somewhat open-ended, so you have a chance to follow
whatever interests you may have. You can summarize a branch of probability, do some
enlightening examples or proofs of topics we already covered, summarize a research paper,
or go into depth on a topic we covered only briefly. 

# Requirements

Your instructor will assign you into groups of two or three based on common interests.
You are also encouraged to study and work with your group on other course material.
A discussion board and "locker" (place to store files) restricted to your group
will be set up for you to use in D2L.
You may use that discussion board for group communication,
or your can set up your own communication preference
(e.g., Microsoft Team, Slack, etc.).
Each member of the group has a responsibility to communicate with the other
members of the group on a regular basis and start on each project component
well before the deadline.

The final project will consist of:

1. **Proposal**. A short paragraph with the names of your group and a few sentences describing what you plan to research for your project. The proposal must include at least _three_ references of papers, articles, books, etc.\ that you plan to use for your project. 

2. **Report**. A 4--5 page, 12 pt font, single-spaced, written report of your topic. (Tables and figures are included in the page limit; references and appendices (if needed) are not.) It is required that the report be written in R Markdown. The report must include:  
    * A descriptive title,
    * Name(s) of your group,
    * In-text citations and a list of references in a consistent format, e.g., APA.
    * If applicable, any R code should be included as an appendix.
    The body of the report is not required to fit a specific outline, since it will vary depending on the topic, but generally papers have some sort of introduction, background, results or discussion, and conclusion.

3. **Peer review**. Each individual will review one anonymized draft of your peers' projects. Peer reviews will be graded individually, based on the completeness and constructiveness of your feedback. A rubric for providing feedback will be provided.

4. **Presentation**. A 10-minute in-class presentation on your topic. Presentations will be held during the last week of classes---Wednesday December 7 and Friday December 9.
It is expected that each group member present an equal portion of the material.
